After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).","id":"5e9e4502f509092b78566f87"},"flight_number":46,"name":"FormoSat-5","date_utc":"2017-08-24T18:50:00.000Z","date_unix":1503600600,"date_local":"2017-08-24T11:50:00-07:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a4f359182d843b264e","flight":1,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":false,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3033383ecbb9e534e7cc"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5eb87d08ffd86e000604b357"}],"day after tomorrow":[{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://images2.imgbox.com/5c/36/gbDKf6Y7_o.png","large":"https://images2.imgbox.com/d6/12/yxne8mMD_o.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":null,"launch":null,"media":null,"recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":"http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=21869.0;attach=230821","webcast":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxSxgBKlYws","youtube_id":"nxSxgBKlYws","article":"http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/02/12/falcon-9-flight-1","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Spacecraft_Qualification_Unit"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2010-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1268438400,"net":false,"window":0,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":["5eb0e4b7b6c3bb0006eeb1e7"],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":95,"launch_successes":93,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","61bf3e31cd5ab50b0d936345","6161d32d6db1a92bfba85359","61fc01dae0dc5662b76489a7","61fc0243e0dc5662b76489ae","6234908cf051102e1fcedac4","6243ad8baf52800c6e919252","6243ada6af52800c6e919253","62582a6f5988f159024b964b","625828f25988f159024b9643","6243ae24af52800c6e919258","6243ae0aaf52800c6e919257","62a9f08b20413d2695d88711","6243aea5af52800c6e91925c","62a9f0c920413d2695d88712","62a9f0f820413d2695d88714","62a9f12820413d2695d88716","62a9f86420413d2695d88719"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.
