SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017.

The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":49,"name":"SES-11 / Echostar 105","date_utc":"2017-10-11T22:53:00.000Z","date_unix":1507762380,"date_local":"2017-10-11T18:53:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a3f3591829dc3b2646","flight":2,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5eb87d0cffd86e000604b35a"},{"fairings":{"reused":false,"recovery_attempt":false,"recovered":false,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://images2.imgbox.com/95/ec/FoFpPft0_o.png","large":"https://images2.imgbox.com/42/0a/LAupFe3L_o.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7olw86/govsat1_ses16_launch_campaign_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7tvtbh/rspacex_govsat1_official_launch_discussion/","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7tzzwy/rspacex_govsat1_media_thread_videos_images_gifs/","recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":["https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4721/40026315981_f16a7cd32a_o.jpg","https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/40026316291_0b3aef9d8d_o.jpg","https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4652/39128355655_3eefa0d583_o.jpg","https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4741/39128355825_7c4166dbbe_o.jpg","https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4609/39128355355_17381fc00e_o.jpg"]},"presskit":"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/govsat1presskit.pdf","webcast":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScYUA51-POQ","youtube_id":"ScYUA51-POQ","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/01/31/spacex-rocket-flies-on-60th-anniversary-of-first-u-s-satellite-launch/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SES_satellites#SES_Fleet"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2018-01-26T15:27:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1516980420,"net":false,"window":8460,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":"Reused booster from the classified NROL-76 mission in May 2017.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).","id":"5e9e4502f509092b78566f87"},"flight_number":148,"name":"NROL-87","date_utc":"2022-02-02T20:18:00.000Z","date_unix":1643833080,"date_local":"2022-02-02T12:18:00-08:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"61fae5947aa67176fe3e0e1e","flight":1,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":false,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"RTLS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb554034e7c9"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"2e650790-ff3e-434a-b028-a6a1a13cfc94","id":"607a34e35a906a44023e085e"},{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/IJWn9pK.png","large":"https://imgur.com/u49XVx4.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":null,"launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/uxafkb/rspacex_transporter5_launch_discussion_and/","media":null,"recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/KHt3MyimuqU","youtube_id":"KHt3MyimuqU","article":null,"wikipedia":null},"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":["6243b39daf52800c6e919267"],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":95,"launch_successes":93,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","61bf3e31cd5ab50b0d936345","6161d32d6db1a92bfba85359","61fc01dae0dc5662b76489a7","61fc0243e0dc5662b76489ae","6234908cf051102e1fcedac4","6243ad8baf52800c6e919252","6243ada6af52800c6e919253","62582a6f5988f159024b964b","625828f25988f159024b9643","6243ae24af52800c6e919258","6243ae0aaf52800c6e919257","62a9f08b20413d2695d88711","6243aea5af52800c6e91925c","62a9f0c920413d2695d88712","62a9f0f820413d2695d88714","62a9f12820413d2695d88716","62a9f86420413d2695d88719"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

The booster for this mission will land on OCISLY.","crew":[],"ships":["5ea6ed30080df4000697c913","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90c","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90e","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90b","5ea6ed2e080df4000697c909"],"capsules":[],"payloads":["5eb0e4cbb6c3bb0006eeb238"],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":95,"launch_successes":93,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","61bf3e31cd5ab50b0d936345","6161d32d6db1a92bfba85359","61fc01dae0dc5662b76489a7","61fc0243e0dc5662b76489ae","6234908cf051102e1fcedac4","6243ad8baf52800c6e919252","6243ada6af52800c6e919253","62582a6f5988f159024b964b","625828f25988f159024b9643","6243ae24af52800c6e919258","6243ae0aaf52800c6e919257","62a9f08b20413d2695d88711","6243aea5af52800c6e91925c","62a9f0c920413d2695d88712","62a9f0f820413d2695d88714","62a9f12820413d2695d88716","62a9f86420413d2695d88719"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":144,"name":"Starlink 4-5

The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":173,"name":"CRS-25","date_utc":"2022-07-15T00:44:00.000Z","date_unix":1657845840,"date_local":"2022-07-14T20:44:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"60b800111f83cc1e59f16438","flight":5,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3033383ecb075134e7cd"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"2773613e-58eb-4b99-8120-595c92aa3390","id":"6243ae40af52800c6e919259"},{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhu37i/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":null,"media":null,"recovery":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/k2ts1q/rspacex_fleet_updates_discussion_thread/"},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/BuXdtORWrpg","youtube_id":"BuXdtORWrpg","article":null,"wikipedia":null},"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":[],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/asp5L08.png"]},"name":"VAFB SLC 4E","full_name":"Vandenberg Space Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E","locality":"Vandenberg Space Force Base","region":"California","latitude":34.632093,"longitude":-120.610829,"launch_attempts":27,"launch_successes":26,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","launches":["5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b334","5eb87cf0ffd86e000604b343","5eb87cfdffd86e000604b34c","5eb87d05ffd86e000604b354","5eb87d08ffd86e000604b357","5eb87d0affd86e000604b359","5eb87d0fffd86e000604b35d","5eb87d14ffd86e000604b361","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b363","5eb87d1affd86e000604b367","5eb87d1fffd86e000604b36b","5eb87d23ffd86e000604b36e","5eb87d25ffd86e000604b370","5eb87d28ffd86e000604b373","5eb87d31ffd86e000604b379","5ed983aa1f30554030d45c31","60e3bf0d73359e1e20335c37","5fe3b107b3467846b324216b","61bba806437241381bf7061e","607a34e35a906a44023e085e","61fc0203e0dc5662b76489a8","6243adcaaf52800c6e919254","6258290d5988f159024b9644","5fe3af43b3467846b324215e","62a9f0e320413d2695d88713","62a9f10b20413d2695d88715","62f3b4ff0f55c50e192a4e6b"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary west coast launch pad for polar orbits and sun-synchronous orbits, primarily used for Iridium NEXT and scientific satellite launches.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":76,"name":"CCtCap Demo Mission 1","date_utc":"2019-03-02T07:45:00.000Z","date_unix":1551512700,"date_local":"2019-03-02T02:45:00-05:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a6f35918c0803b265c","flight":1,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":false,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5eb87d2bffd86e000604b375"},{"fairings":null,"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://images2.imgbox.com/fc/58/9UErD3ut_o.png","large":"https://images2.imgbox.com/12/47/6uim8L1a_o.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://new.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/bd2l28/crs17_launch_campaign_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/bjsn0v/rspacex_crs17_official_launch_discussion_updates","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/bkc4d5/rspacex_crs17_media_thread_videos_images_gifs","recovery":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/bjy7p5/rspacex_crs17_recovery_discussion_updates_thread"},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":["https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46856594435_206c773b5a_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47720639872_284e49381d_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46856594755_88f1b22e50_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47720639542_1b7c1a71b0_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47720639732_e04b2a9ed7_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/32829382467_087d024428_o.jpg"]},"presskit":"https://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/crs-17_press_kit.pdf","webcast":"https://youtu.be/AQFhX5TvP0M","youtube_id":"AQFhX5TvP0M","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/05/04/spacex-launches-space-station-resupply-mission-lands-rocket-on-drone-ship/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-17"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2019-04-27T07:23:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1556349780,"net":false,"window":0,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":"SpaceX's 17th Commercial Resupply Services mission for NASA out of a total of 20 contracted flights, this mission brings essential supplies to the International Space Station using SpaceX's reusable Dragon 1 spacecraft.

It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).","id":"5e9e4502f509092b78566f87"},"flight_number":151,"name":"Starlink 4-11 (v1.5)","date_utc":"2022-02-25T17:12:00.000Z","date_unix":1645809120,"date_local":"2022-02-25T09:12:00-08:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5f57c54a0622a633027900a1","flight":4,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"b7b24770-f9dd-40eb-adad-da95e917e55d","id":"61fc0203e0dc5662b76489a8"},{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhu37i/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":null,"media":null,"recovery":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/k2ts1q/rspacex_fleet_updates_discussion_thread/"},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":["https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51947052831_3b1599cd70_o.jpg","https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51946071252_b51d6839e9_o.jpg"]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/0giA6VZOICs","youtube_id":"0giA6VZOICs","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2022/03/19/spacex-stretches-rocket-reuse-record-with-another-starlink-launch/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink"},"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":["623491e5f051102e1fcedac9"],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":95,"launch_successes":93,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","61bf3e31cd5ab50b0d936345","6161d32d6db1a92bfba85359","61fc01dae0dc5662b76489a7","61fc0243e0dc5662b76489ae","6234908cf051102e1fcedac4","6243ad8baf52800c6e919252","6243ada6af52800c6e919253","62582a6f5988f159024b964b","625828f25988f159024b9643","6243ae24af52800c6e919258","6243ae0aaf52800c6e919257","62a9f08b20413d2695d88711","6243aea5af52800c6e91925c","62a9f0c920413d2695d88712","62a9f0f820413d2695d88714","62a9f12820413d2695d88716","62a9f86420413d2695d88719"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":156,"name":"Ax-1","date_utc":"2022-04-08T15:17:00.000Z","date_unix":1649431020,"date_local":"2022-04-08T11:17:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5f57c5440622a633027900a0","flight":5,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3033383ecb075134e7cd"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"a3eeb03b-a209-4255-91b5-772dc0d2150e","id":"61eefaa89eb1064137a1bd73"},{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhu37i/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":null,"media":null,"recovery":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/k2ts1q/rspacex_fleet_updates_discussion_thread/"},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/skNrXnubpwA","youtube_id":"skNrXnubpwA","article":null,"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink"},"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":["62582aa55988f159024b964d"],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":95,"launch_successes":93,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","61bf3e31cd5ab50b0d936345","6161d32d6db1a92bfba85359","61fc01dae0dc5662b76489a7","61fc0243e0dc5662b76489ae","6234908cf051102e1fcedac4","6243ad8baf52800c6e919252","6243ada6af52800c6e919253","62582a6f5988f159024b964b","625828f25988f159024b9643","6243ae24af52800c6e919258","6243ae0aaf52800c6e919257","62a9f08b20413d2695d88711","6243aea5af52800c6e91925c","62a9f0c920413d2695d88712","62a9f0f820413d2695d88714","62a9f12820413d2695d88716","62a9f86420413d2695d88719"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.

It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).","id":"5e9e4502f509092b78566f87"},"flight_number":162,"name":"Starlink 4-13 (v1.5)","date_utc":"2022-05-13T22:07:00.000Z","date_unix":1652479620,"date_local":"2022-05-13T15:07:00-07:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5f57c54a0622a633027900a1","flight":5,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"0bc91464-1d61-4545-95c8-01040dc5eec9","id":"6258290d5988f159024b9644"},{"fairings":{"reused":null,"recovery_attempt":null,"recovered":null,"ships":[]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhu37i/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/wmgtiu/rspacex_starlink_33_launch_discussion_and_updates/","media":null,"recovery":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/k2ts1q/rspacex_fleet_updates_discussion_thread/"},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/SU5FbiCbjic","youtube_id":"SU5FbiCbjic","article":null,"wikipedia":null},"static_fire_date_utc":null,"static_fire_date_unix":null,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":null,"crew":[],"ships":[],"capsules":[],"payloads":[],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/asp5L08.png"]},"name":"VAFB SLC 4E","full_name":"Vandenberg Space Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E","locality":"Vandenberg Space Force Base","region":"California","latitude":34.632093,"longitude":-120.610829,"launch_attempts":27,"launch_successes":26,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","launches":["5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b334","5eb87cf0ffd86e000604b343","5eb87cfdffd86e000604b34c","5eb87d05ffd86e000604b354","5eb87d08ffd86e000604b357","5eb87d0affd86e000604b359","5eb87d0fffd86e000604b35d","5eb87d14ffd86e000604b361","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b363","5eb87d1affd86e000604b367","5eb87d1fffd86e000604b36b","5eb87d23ffd86e000604b36e","5eb87d25ffd86e000604b370","5eb87d28ffd86e000604b373","5eb87d31ffd86e000604b379","5ed983aa1f30554030d45c31","60e3bf0d73359e1e20335c37","5fe3b107b3467846b324216b","61bba806437241381bf7061e","607a34e35a906a44023e085e","61fc0203e0dc5662b76489a8","6243adcaaf52800c6e919254","6258290d5988f159024b9644","5fe3af43b3467846b324215e","62a9f0e320413d2695d88713","62a9f10b20413d2695d88715","62f3b4ff0f55c50e192a4e6b"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary west coast launch pad for polar orbits and sun-synchronous orbits, primarily used for Iridium NEXT and scientific satellite launches.
