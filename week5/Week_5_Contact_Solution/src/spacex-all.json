After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":104,"name":"Starlink-13 (v1.0)","date_utc":"2020-10-18T12:25:00.000Z","date_unix":1603023900,"date_local":"2020-10-18T08:25:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a6f35918c0803b265c","flight":6,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5ef6a2bf0059c33cee4a828c","weather":{"temperature":"+23 °C","wind":"7 km/h","description":"Clear","forecast":[{"day":"1","temperature":"28 °C","wind":"5 km/h"},{"day":"2","temperature":"+27 °C","wind":"6 km/h"},{"day":"3","temperature":" °C","wind":"7 km/h"}]}},{"fairings":{"reused":false,"recovery_attempt":true,"recovered":null,"ships":["5ea6ed2e080df4000697c907","5ea6ed2e080df4000697c908"]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/i63bst/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jetth8/rspacex_starlink14_official_launch_discussion/","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhcwun/rspacex_starlink14_media_thread_photographer/","recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/2gbVgTxLgN0","youtube_id":"2gbVgTxLgN0","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/10/24/spacex-adds-another-60-satellites-to-starlink-network/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2020-10-21T12:55:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1603284900,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":"This mission will launch the fourteenth batch of operational Starlink satellites, which are expected to be version 1.0, from SLC-40, Kennedy Space Center.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":104,"name":"Starlink-13 (v1.0)","date_utc":"2020-10-18T12:25:00.000Z","date_unix":1603023900,"date_local":"2020-10-18T08:25:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a6f35918c0803b265c","flight":6,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5ef6a2bf0059c33cee4a828c","weather":{"temperature":"+23 °C","wind":"7 km/h","description":"Clear","forecast":[{"day":"1","temperature":"28 °C","wind":"5 km/h"},{"day":"2","temperature":"+27 °C","wind":"6 km/h"},{"day":"3","temperature":" °C","wind":"7 km/h"}]}},{"fairings":{"reused":false,"recovery_attempt":true,"recovered":null,"ships":["5ea6ed2e080df4000697c907","5ea6ed2e080df4000697c908"]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/i63bst/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jetth8/rspacex_starlink14_official_launch_discussion/","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhcwun/rspacex_starlink14_media_thread_photographer/","recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/2gbVgTxLgN0","youtube_id":"2gbVgTxLgN0","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/10/24/spacex-adds-another-60-satellites-to-starlink-network/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2020-10-21T12:55:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1603284900,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":"This mission will launch the fourteenth batch of operational Starlink satellites, which are expected to be version 1.0, from SLC-40, Kennedy Space Center.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":104,"name":"Starlink-13 (v1.0)","date_utc":"2020-10-18T12:25:00.000Z","date_unix":1603023900,"date_local":"2020-10-18T08:25:00-04:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5e9e28a6f35918c0803b265c","flight":6,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":null,"id":"5ef6a2bf0059c33cee4a828c","weather":{"temperature":"+23 °C","wind":"7 km/h","description":"Clear","forecast":[{"day":"1","temperature":"28 °C","wind":"5 km/h"},{"day":"2","temperature":"+27 °C","wind":"6 km/h"},{"day":"3","temperature":" °C","wind":"7 km/h"}]}},{"fairings":{"reused":false,"recovery_attempt":true,"recovered":null,"ships":["5ea6ed2e080df4000697c907","5ea6ed2e080df4000697c908"]},"links":{"patch":{"small":"https://imgur.com/BrW201S.png","large":"https://imgur.com/573IfGk.png"},"reddit":{"campaign":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/i63bst/starlink_general_discussion_and_deployment_thread/","launch":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jetth8/rspacex_starlink14_official_launch_discussion/","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/jhcwun/rspacex_starlink14_media_thread_photographer/","recovery":null},"flickr":{"small":[],"original":[]},"presskit":null,"webcast":"https://youtu.be/2gbVgTxLgN0","youtube_id":"2gbVgTxLgN0","article":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/10/24/spacex-adds-another-60-satellites-to-starlink-network/","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink"},"static_fire_date_utc":"2020-10-21T12:55:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1603284900,"net":false,"window":null,"rocket":"5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec","success":true,"failures":[],"details":"This mission will launch the fourteenth batch of operational Starlink satellites, which are expected to be version 1.0, from SLC-40, Kennedy Space Center.

After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling.
