/**
  What is a promise?
  A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.
  A promise is in one of these states:
  - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
  - rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
  A promise is settled if itâ€™s not pending (it has been resolved or rejected).
  Once settled, a promise can not be resettled.
  Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
  Promises are one way to deal with asynchronous code, without writing too many callbacks.
  Promises can be consumed by registering functions using .then and .catch methods.
  The .then method is executed when the promise is resolved.
  The .catch method is executed when the promise is rejected.

    // do something
    if (isSuccessful) {
      resolve("Stuff worked!");
    } else {
      reject(Error("It broke"));
    }
  });
  promise
    .then((result) => {
      logger.green(result); // Stuff worked!
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      logger.red(err); // Error
    });
